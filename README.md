- My name is **Axel Olsson**.  I am a self taught, full stack web developer currently working at Epic, the leading electronic medical records company in America as a Software QA.  I have spent the past 8 months teaching myself all there is to know about Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML/CSS, and React.js with the hope of breaking into the field of software engineering. 
- I am a problem solver, both in my current job and outside as a developer.  I am motivated by understanding complex problems and finding the best, simplest, and most efficient solutions to them.
- I am dedicated to software development.  Solving puzzles in this field is what gets me up in the morning.  I love every aspect of development, even the tedious parts :)
- I have all the soft-skills of someone who has worked in customer facing / sales roles with all of the skills of a developer.  My time in other roles and as a free lance web developer have prepared me with the communication skills necessary in 21st century business.
